## Editor


Once logged in as admin, place your mouse over the black bar at the top of the screen. The editor should drop down and look like the follow images.


**Before**

- - -
<img src="tut-imgs/1.png" alt="image not found" />

- - -


**After**


- - -

<img src="tut-imgs/2.png" alt="image not found" />

- - -


The following is a description of the image that follows after the next text body.

* In the orange annotation border, there are two buttons. One compiles all your page edits into a raw markup string ready for export. The other compiles all your page edits into a html string ready for export.

* In the blue annotation border, there are two buttons. The apply button will take the input placed in the editor and append it to your final page preview. If you're editing an existing section within the page preview, the section will be overwritten with the supplied input. The cancel button clears all input and erases the section preview section.

* In the yellow annotation border at the bottom, the access path is the routing path of the final document. This will be explained further in later documentation.

* In the green annotation border at the bottom is the title of the final document.

* The save button will write a flat file read to be served.

## Editor Input

The following is a description of the image that follows after the next text body.

* Markdown goes in the ```<md></md>``` tags or else it's considered HTML.

* The section preview is updated on every key press.

You have to click the apply button to add it to your final page preview.


- - -

<img src="tut-imgs/5.png" alt="image not found" />

- - -


Each time you add a section, it gets appended to the final page preview.

<img src="tut-imgs/6.png" alt="image not found" />

## Layout Arrangement

When you put your mouse over a page section, that section's menu will be displayed along with a dotted outline.


- - -

<img src="tut-imgs/7.png" alt="image not found" />

- - -


To alter the layout you can click the swap or remove buttons. When clicking the swap button, you will also have to click another section's swap button for the swap to take place. The header in this image is swapped with the third section.

## Saving Web Pages

In the following image, the access path is set to "example/category/hello world",
and the page title is set to "This is my title".


- - -

<img src="tut-imgs/9.png" alt="image not found" />

- - -


Clicking save make the proper directories and then write to the file "example/category/hello world". You'll be redirected to the new page once this has been completed.

With the default style template, this is what the new page looks like.


- - -

<img src="tut-imgs/10.png" alt="image not found" />

- - -


The static index is generated on every save event. Here's how the page is listed in the static index.


<i>Notice that the file name becomes the link and the parent paths become the header of the files</i>
